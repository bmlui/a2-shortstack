Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  
===

## Name list
I made this website as a people list with function to add, remove, and edit people from the people list. This could be used as a party guest list, attendance list, and more. It also shows the time the person was added to the list as the generated field. There are 4 names in the test data. Just enter the person's name in the box and click submit to add someone to the list. Click delete to delete the person and finally click edit to edit the person's name.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: (5 points)Create a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data. To put it another way, when the user submits data, the server should respond sending back the updated data (including the derived field calculated on the server) and the client should then update its data display.

I had the server respond back when editing, deleting, or adding data and the client added the data accordingly. When adding data, the server responds with the ID of the item and the generated data, the date. This is then implemented into the data table as shown. 

- **Tech Achievement 1**: (5 points) In addition to a form enabling adding and deleting data on the server, also add the ability to modify existing data.

I added a fucntion to modify existing data by clicking on the edit button on the table. 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**:  (5 points per person, with a max of 10 points) Test your user interface with other students in the class. Define a specific task for them to complete (ideally something short that takes <10 minutes), and then use the think-aloud protocol to obtain feedback on your design (talk-aloud is also fine). Important considerations when designing your study:

Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.

What problems did the user have with your design?
The only problem was the spacing of the data and that the data on the table can be hard to differentiate as there are no borders. 

What comments did they make that surprised you?
Nothing really suprised me exept for the fact that the site was fast!

What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
I would make it more user friendly by adding borders to the table and also prevent duplicate names or empty names from being added to the list.
